# Docker for JavaScript Developers

This conference talk is about effective use of Docker for JavaScript developers.

All the examples are using code from two GitHub repositories:

* Frontend with webpack: https://github.com/jzaefferer/docker-for-js-devs
* Backend with nodejs: https://github.com/jzaefferer/docker-for-nodejs-devs

## Usage of these slides

Adopted from [Google's IO 2012 slides](https://code.google.com/p/io-2012-slides/)

To regenerate CSS files, use

    compass compile

Open `index.html` from filesystem or local server.

### Presenter mode

The slides contain a presenter mode feature to view + control the slides
from a popup window.

To enable presenter mode, add `presentme=true` to the URL: [http://localhost:8000/index.html?presentme=true](http://localhost:8000/index.html?presentme=true)

To disable presenter mode, hit [http://localhost:8000/index.html?presentme=false](http://localhost:8000/index.html?presentme=false)

Presenter mode is sticky, so refreshing the page will persist your settings.

When activing, a popup is opened. Use that on your laptop's screen, and go full-screen on the opener tab. Move that to the projector screen.
